I start by declaring my struct node, each with a number and pointer to the next node. My print function simply notifies the user if the list is empty, and otherwise utilizes a throwawy f pointer to help traverse and print the entire linked list. The main simply populates the linked list, and outputs the original list, and the sorted even and odd lists respectively. It uses dividing each value by 2 and checking if the remainder is 0 in order to see if each value is positive or negative.
