I first declared a struct to control each Node in my linked list, each having an integer value and a pointer to the next node in the list. My sumEvens function checks first to see if the inputted Node is null, and if so, notifies the user and returns 0. I declare a new node to help in traversing through the rest of the linked list. I then enter a loop to check if the value of each node is even, by seeing if the remainder of that number and 2 is 0. If the number is in fact even, it is added to the total for the entire list. This repeats until the entier linked list has been traversed. My entire main function then is just populating the linked list and outputting the correct texts. It first outputs the entire contents of the list, then runs the sumEvens program to output the sum of the even values of the list.
