My sumRange function simply calls a helper function which then uses an in order traversal to scan the entire tree. At each node, the function checks to see if the key is greater than the minimum value and less than the maximum value, and if so it adds it to the sum of all the values. My main implements 3 different trees, displays them in a linear fashion, then also outputs the sum of the values within the given range.
