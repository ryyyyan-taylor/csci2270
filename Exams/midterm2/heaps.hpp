/*

DISCLAIMER: This is a standard heap implementation we recommend everyone to at least have these functions implemented properly.

For the exams the variable type might change form int to char / any other custom type.
You will also have extra functions which will be the main exam problem which will be added to the hpp file and it will be given to you during your exam
